- User invitation tokens expire after 7 days
- Sensitive data (passwords) excluded from API responses
- Audit logging for all user management actions

### Privacy Compliance
- Personal data handling follows privacy regulations
- User consent for data processing
- Data retention policies implemented
- Secure data export with access controls
